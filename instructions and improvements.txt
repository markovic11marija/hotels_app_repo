Notes: 
I've used Swagger so you can see Api documentation there, also can be used for testing. 
I've used EntityFramework code first approach, and configured that migrations and seedings gets executed on running app.

Things that I didn't have time to implement and would be nice: 
I've would add oauth token authentification;
Would hash passwords for users;
Would add paging for large amount of data - and than use skip and take in EntityFramework
I've added globalExceptionHandler, but some writting in file would also be nice
